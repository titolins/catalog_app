        This is the 3rd exercise from Udacity's FullStack Web Developer
        Nanodegree.

    <p>
        If you have executed the populatedb script, you will see some categories
        for you to browse on the sidebar to the left (or right above this text,
        if you are on a smartphone or tablet).
    </p>
    <p>
        Otherwise, please feel
        free to create as many categories as you may need! Please note, however,
        that you need to be logged in to create new categories.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once logged in, a plus sign will appear on the sidebar which will take
        you to the new category page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enjoy!! ;)
